# MLX Swift LM

MLX Swift LM is a Swift package to build tools and applications with large
language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) in [MLX Swift](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift).

Some key features include:

- Integration with the Hugging Face Hub to easily use thousands of LLMs with a single command.
- Low-rank (LoRA) and full model fine-tuning with support for quantized models.
- Many model architectures for both LLMs and VLMs.

For some example applications and tools that use MLX Swift LM check out
the [MLX Swift Examples](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples).

# Using MLX Swift LM

The MLXLLM, MLXVLM, MLXLMCommon, and MLXEmbedders libraries are available
as Swift Packages.

Add the following dependency to your Package.swift:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-lm/", branch: "main"),
```

or use the latest release:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-lm/", .upToNextMinor(from: "2.29.1")),
```

Then add one or more libraries to the target as a dependency:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTargetName",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "MLXLLM", package: "mlx-swift-lm")
    ]),
```

Alternatively, add `https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-lm/` to the
`Project Dependencies` and set the `Dependency Rule` to `Branch` and `main` in
Xcode.

# Quick Start

See also [MLXLMCommon](Libraries/MLXLMCommon). You can get started with a wide
variety of open weights LLMs and VLMs using this simplified API:

```swift
let model = try await loadModel(id: "mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-4bit")
let session = ChatSession(model)
print(try await session.respond(to: "What are two things to see in San Francisco?")
print(try await session.respond(to: "How about a great place to eat?")
```

Or use the underlying API to control every aspect of the evaluation.
